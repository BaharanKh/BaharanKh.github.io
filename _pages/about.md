Hi there! Thanks for visiting my website. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UC San Diego, advised by [prof. Babak Salimi](https://bsalimi.github.io/).
My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, with an emphasis on data debiasing, data management, and causal inference. I explore these topics across diverse applications and data modalities, including tabular data, large language models, and recommender systems.
